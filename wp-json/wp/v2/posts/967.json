The overly large steering wheel contains barely a jot of feel, while the biggest bumps you can find will all be smothered entirely by the suspension. My first few hours guiding the ginormous feeling Dawn around are pretty tentative,\u00a0then.<\/p>\n<p>Yes and no.

At first, it feels like Rolls is doing everything it can to throw keen drivers off the scent: the steering is super slow, there\u2019s no option to manually control the gears, and there\u2019s barely any engine braking when you lift off the throttle, so you heave on the hard-working brakes more than you\u2019d\u00a0like.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-full-width-img\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/960x540\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3492 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/960x540\" alt=\"cmx16_pg_009_ext_full\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n<p>Yet once you realise there\u2019s plenty of grip hiding beneath all those cocooning layers of comfort, you can have a go at driving this thing quickly. The trick is not taking lots of speed into a bend \u2013 there\u2019s simply too much mass for that \u2013 but to carefully turn in and, once the car has obliged, use an indulgent amount of throttle so that the rear squats down and you ride that wave of luxurious speed out of the corner. Get the hang of it and you can carry some serious pace across country\u00a0roads.<\/p>\n<p>Equally, of course, you can settle down, using the smallest smidgen of its \u2018Power Reserve\u2019 gauge possible (rev counters are so unclassy) and enjoy what a masterfully refined car this is. Roof up, the silence is zen-like, and full-size adults will still be comfy in the\u00a0back.<\/p>\n<p>Above 50mph and things can get a little cold and blustery if the soft top is folded, however. But let\u2019s blame Britain\u2019s wintry weather for that rather than the car. If it all gets a bit much, the roof can be operated at up to 30mph, though given the sheer size of it, the mechanism does take a little\u00a0while.<\/p>\n<h2>Any other\u00a0demerits?<\/h2>\n<p>If we\u2019re nitpicking, yes. There\u2019s only one USB port, and it\u2019s located very unhelpfully if you wish keep your phone charged while using a sat nav app. And the Dawn isn\u2019t much fun to\u00a0park.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Ken Block Drifts London \u2013 EXTENDED Director&#039;s Cut | Top Gear | BBC\" width=\"743\" height=\"418\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PrqYohBV58o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, though, it\u2019s as supreme as you\u2019d hope. Perhaps more so. The materials are almost beyond description: only a few rogue buttons and the media screen layout highlight any BMW parts sharing, and everything from the copious swathes of wood to the thickly piled carpets (I\u2019ve never had anything as plush in my house) will make you feel so, so good. As does driving with the Spirit of Ecstasy in the middle of your view\u00a0forwards.<\/p>\n<p>Rolls-Royce unashamedly goes its own way, even if that does make its cars ergonomically odd. The heating controls demand a degree of guesswork and the doors take some getting used to. But there\u2019s so much class and character here. It\u2019s an inspirational and irresistable car. The ultimate compliment? This one is specced to \u00a3331,500, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel short-changed if I\u2019d actually paid\u00a0that.<\/p>\n<p>That tells us it\u2019s an Audi Q5, BMW X3, Mercedes GLC and Porsche Macan rival. It looks nicely sharp and chiseled, in a way the car it replaces \u2013 did you know you can currently buy an Infiniti QX50? \u2013 isn\u2019t. The new one looks decent,\u00a0no?<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"alignleft quote-simple \"><p>It will \u2018delegate\u2019 more onerous driving tasks to the car.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s a concept for now, and that means little technical detail but much styling chatter.
